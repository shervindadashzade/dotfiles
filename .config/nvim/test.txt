Remember how I said Space mode is a LazyVim concept? Insert mode is an original Vi concept,
that the successors Vim, then Neovim, and now LazyVim have all inherited. In Insert mode,
the vast majority of keystrokes do what you would expect in any editor: they insert text. So you can touch type as usual.
